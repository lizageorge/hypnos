# Hypnos (archived)

I started thinking of this project over a year ago as a way for me to motivate myself to learn how to use different tools and libraries. But this method of teaching myself web development quickly fell apart - I wasn't getting the satisfaction of seeing my work grow or of creating any code myself at all. And as the rest of my life became increasingly demanding, spending time on just learning how to create something through online courses without actually creating anything became less and less appealing. 

But! Now I have the summer break before college to give this another shot. I will be creating Hypnos, just as I originally imagined it, but this time prioritizing seeing my results change as a I learn instead of learning everything about a particular tool first. Because I’m basically restarting from scratch, and this repository doesn’t have much progress and a bunch of outdated dependencies, I’ll be recording the work of this retry in a new repository: hypnos-ii! 

This isn’t exactly how I envisioned this project going. But I hope I can learn from my mistakes, and I’m excited to give this another shot >:)
